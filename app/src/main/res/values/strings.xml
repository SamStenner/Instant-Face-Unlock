    <string name="pie_prefs">Unfortunately, custom preferences for IFU is not yet supported on Android Pie or above.
        It may be possible, but doesn\'t seem to be working as it did in Oreo. If you\'d like to contribute to the project
        to enable this feature then you\'re welcome to check out the IFU Github project.

    <string name="sd_card_error">
        Instant Face Unlock has been installed on an SD card. In order to work properly, it must be moved onto your internal storage.
        However, because the app has been opened before you moved it, you need to uninstall it completely. Once it is installed again,
        move it from your SD card to your internal storage BEFORE doing a reboot. I hope to fix this in a future update, apologies
        for the inconvenience.
